<!--Finally, a game I am familiar with! LOL! Simplest way for me to picture this on a computer
was to do a table. Thankfully, HTML seems to make sense to me enough that my HTML page wasn't too
strenuous. I did some super simple styling to make it visually pleasing on my end. After the HTML is 
when things got interesting. I thankfully had a little time to research things, due to being home
with strep throat. Yep, you read that right...going on week three of immune system overload.-->

<!--This one gave me some trouble. I tried to write my button here, but then have the functionality be in my 
JavaScript file...it wasn't having it. I swear I've done that in another project, but can't remember which
one off the top of my head. I had moved a portion of code here to be a reminder to ask how the heck to get a function
going. Low and behold...the browser page works! So still trying to figure that out. Feedback would be GREAT, so I 
can skip struggling so hard next time.-->
